** TICTACTOE built on ReactJS**

## Objective
The main objective of this project was to build an application that utilizes React's quick performance while honing my skillset on the React Framework

## Future plans for the app
*Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
*Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.(Completed but using background color instead)
*Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
*Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
*When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
